## Projects

<p> Project 1: Testing "Personal Event" Functionality in Skyeng Web Application for Teachers</p>
Project Description: Teachers can use personal events for their own meetings.
<p>Tasks Completed::<p>
<ol>
  <li>TProduct verification using functional and non-functional testing.</li>
  <li>Product verification using API.</li>
</ol>

<p>Approach: Brief description of the solution (self-reflection)<p>

I utilized Qase.io and Sitechko applications for creating test cases and checklists. For API testing, I employed Postman. For the first task, I divided it into 5 steps: 1. Understanding the requirements, 2. Analyzing stakeholders and creating acceptance test cases, 3. Testing requirements, 4. Product decomposition, 5. Creating a Test Plan. Similarly, I divided the second task into steps: 1. Studying the API documentation, 2. Creating a Postman collection, 3. Adding to the testing report.

 <p>Conclusions:<p>
<ol>
  <li>The testing was successful; the old functionality for rescheduling and canceling lessons is fully operational.</li>
  <li>API testing was also successful.</li>
</ol>

Through my first project, I learned how to properly create test cases and checklists, perform testing without documentation, create product decomposition, test requirements, write bug reports, and make requests during API testing.
